# Reddit-Remake
A remake of the reddit website

to install front end modules use bower:
"bower install module --save"
(the .bowerrc) is set up to move the modules to assets/lib

to view: 
"open index.html" 

for comments branch:
"bower install angular-utils-disqus", i don't think "bower install module --save" will do anything, as the bower.json file never changed
